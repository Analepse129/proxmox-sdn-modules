# proxmox-sdn-modules
Ansible modules for Proxmox VE SDN feature.
Inspired by the work of Sergei Antipov (UnderGreen) for the proxmox_pool module.

## Installing
Copy the files in your ansible modules folder.

## Using
You can use the file "playbook.yml" as an example.

## Limitations
This is a beta version. ~~It only supports "simple" zones and vnets creation.~~ All the API options should implemented yet. 
More documentation and examples are to come in the future. 

Feel free to help me with the developpement of those modules if you're interested in.
